A friend in local government remarked to me that it was frustrating that, when the CDC updates its COVID-19 guidelines, it does not communicate those changes to local and state governments.

Effectively, somebody in the local city government would have to repeatedly hit refresh on the CDC website to obtain any new information.

This is a script designed to automate that task. It includes a specialized web scraper and uses difflib to find the changes between the current version and the version as of the last time the script was run.
